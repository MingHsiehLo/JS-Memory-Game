# JS Memory Game
* This is a memory game developed in **pure JavaScript**. Most HTML is dynamically created and appended using JavaScript. Also, several CSS animations were added to provide a smoother user experience! :blush:

**How to play**

* Start the game by clicking on a card to flip it. If two flipped cards match, they'll disappear! Otherwise, the cards will be flipped back again.
* The game goal is to find the pair of each card, try to finish the game with the least amount of moves! :grin:

**Check the following demo:**

## General info

* **DOM Manipulation:** Using JavaScript, the DOM can be easily handled. In this project, the HTML structure is built with createElement and appendChild. The HTML elements are manipulated by selecting them with querySelector and toggling their classes and event listeners. 

* **Data Manipulation:** The data was stored in the array and map objects and manipulated using splice, forEach and reduce methods.

* **CSS animations and a Responsive Design:** CSS transform, transform-style, transition and @keyframes were used to animate card movements a provide a better experience. CSS media queries along with flexbox were used to create a responsive website.
